Here's a **combined and prioritized to-do list** for your `authlite` package, modeled after `better-auth`. This is ranked from **most critical** (security and core functionality) to **nice-to-have** features (customization and edge cases):

---

## ðŸ”’ High Priority (Must-Have)

### âœ… Session Management

* [ ] Implement secure session storage (DB or external storage).
* [ ] Set default session expiration to 7 days (configurable).
* [ ] Support `updateAge` to extend session expiration (default: 1 day).
* [ ] Expose config options for session lifetime and `updateAge`.

### âœ… CSRF Protection

* [ ] Require **non-simple headers** or `Content-Type: application/json` for POST requests.
  *(Non-simple headers are not in the [CORS safelisted headers list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS-safelisted_request_header))*
* [ ] Validate `Origin` headers against trusted sources.
* [ ] Default to appâ€™s base URL as trusted; allow additional `trustedOrigins`.
* [ ] Prevent mutations on `GET` requests. If unavoidable (e.g., OAuth), validate `nonce` and `state`.
* [ ] Set session cookies with `SameSite=Lax` by default.
* [ ] Add config to disable CSRF checks: `disableCSRFCheck`.
* [ ] Add config to disable origin checks: `disableOriginCheck`.

### âœ… Rate Limiting

* [ ] Implement global rate limiting across all routes.
* [ ] Apply **stricter limits** to sensitive routes (e.g., login, registration).
* [ ] Allow configuration for rate limit thresholds.

### âœ… IP Address Headers

* [ ] Default to using `X-Forwarded-For` for IP detection.
* [ ] Allow trusted headers via `ipAddressHeaders` config (e.g., `cf-connecting-ip`).
* [ ] Ensure headers are only accepted from **trusted proxies**, not directly from users.
* [ ] Add warning in docs to guide users on proper proxy configuration.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Core Features)

### âœ… Session Revocation

* [ ] Implement server-side session revocation (admin/logged-in user can revoke sessions).
* [ ] Enable users to revoke their own sessions across devices (log out from other sessions).
* [ ] Ensure revoked sessions are invalidated immediately and removed from storage.

### âœ… Secure Cookies

* [ ] Set cookies with:

  * `Secure` (when using HTTPS)
  * `HttpOnly` (to block access from JS)
  * `SameSite=Lax` (by default)
* [ ] Allow cookie name customization to prevent fingerprinting.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Advanced / Optional Features)

### âœ… Customizing Cookies

* [ ] Expose config for:

  * Custom cookie names
  * Additional attributes (e.g., `path`, `domain`, `maxAge`)
* [ ] Support `crossSubDomainCookies` config for shared auth across subdomains.
* [ ] Allow plugins to override cookie options per environment (e.g., SSR, non-browser).

### âœ… Trusted Origins

* [ ] Block requests from unknown origins by default.
* [ ] Add `trustedOrigins` config to whitelist known domains (e.g., frontend apps).
* [ ] Help prevent CSRF and open redirect attacks.
